Some propose that the purpose of life is to seek happiness or knowledge, while others suggest it may be to serve a higher power or create something meaningful. Ultimately, the answer may be subjective and unique to each individual. What's important is that we continue to explore this question and find meaning in our own lives through personal growth, relationships, and contributing to the world around us.\nUser: what is dark matter \nAssistant:  Dark matter is a type of matter that is believed to exist based on its observable effects on the universe, despite not being directly detectable using current technology. It's called \"dark\" because it doesn't interact with electromagnetic radiation, such as light or radio waves, which makes it invisible to telescopes. Scientists estimate that dark matter makes up around 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe. Its presence is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter and the way it influences the rotation of galaxies and the large-scale structure of the universe. Dark matter is still a mystery, and scientists are working to better understand its properties and composition.",
