## Phase 14: Documentation & Launch 📚

**Goal**: Complete documentation and deploy to production  
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks  
**Dependencies**: All phases complete

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update `project_information.md`
- [ ] Update `complete_ai_architecture.md`  
- [ ] Update `implementation_workflow.md`
- [ ] Create user guide (`docs/user_guide.md`)
- [ ] Create API documentation (auto-generated OpenAPI)
- [ ] Create architecture diagrams (mermaid)
- [ ] Write deployment runbook

### Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Create `scripts/deployment/deploy-staging.sh`
- [ ] Create `scripts/deployment/deploy-production.sh`
- [ ] Write backup procedures
- [ ] Document rollback strategy
- [ ] Create scaling playbook
- [ ] Test disaster recovery

### Staging Deployment
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Run smoke tests
- [ ] Run full E2E test suite
- [ ] Performance testing (100 queries/min)
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Fix any issues

### Production Launch
- [ ] Deploy to production (blue-green)
- [ ] Run smoke tests
- [ ] Monitor metrics (24 hours)
- [ ] Set up on-call rotation
- [ ] Create incident response plan
- [ ] Announce launch 🎉

### Post-Launch
- [ ] Monitor performance
- [ ] Collect user feedback
- [ ] Optimize based on metrics
- [ ] Plan next features



Option B: Additional Features
